Description: This package computes the cone-convex hull by complement (ccc-hull) of a given sample of points in the plane. 
    The ccc-hull is a generalized convex hull, and its envelope consists of the set of cones. 
    The programming computes appropriate cones for the given sample of points fast. 
    The package also includes a function that plots the result of the ccc-hull.
